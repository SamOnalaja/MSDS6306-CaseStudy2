# MSDS6306-CaseStudy2

The purpose of this analysis is to explore what variables are good predictors for attrition rates in Fortune 1000 companies. Exploratory analytics will be used to determine which variables are the best predictors of attrition, and we will create a model that will predict whether or not an employee will leave their company voluntarily. Finally, we will look at other trends associated with specific jobs and attrition rates.

# Files

All of our code and analysis can be found in the CaseStudy2.Rmd file. The results are viewable on Github from the CaseStudy2.md file. Additional files include training and validation data used in our anlaysis, as well as our attrition predictions for the validation set. The presentation folder contains slides created by the two contributors of this project, Meredith Ludlow and Kristen Rollins.
